# <Refractor Code Project-Welcome to Horiseon!-Accessibility Changes and CSS Cleanup>

## Description

For this challgenge the goal was to make the website more accessible for those who are vision impaired and require a text to speech option in their browser.
I was motivated to make these changes to better understand the way that semantic elements and accessibility changes can impact a website.
I made these changes to benefit those who are vision impaired. These changes make the website easier for them to comprehend.
I learned the way that HTML and CSS elements interact with one another to display the website for the user.
